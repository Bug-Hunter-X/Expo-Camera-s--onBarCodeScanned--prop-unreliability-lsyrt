This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API and involves unexpected behavior related to the `onBarCodeScanned` prop.  The callback function provided to this prop is not always triggered when a barcode is scanned, even when the camera is properly configured and a barcode is clearly visible within the camera's viewfinder.  This inconsistency makes it unreliable to build barcode scanning functionality upon.
